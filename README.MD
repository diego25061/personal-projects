## Travel Agency file manager

This is a progressive web application made for peruvian travel agencies to schedule their orders and services throughout a given period. The project was made using React JS and a backend using Strapi (a node Js based API), both deployed using Heroku. Aditionally, a Mongo database is used by the backend to store data. This is a demo that does not include client side validation due to time constraints. However, it includes many functionalities:

* Reusable frontend components
* User authentication using json web tokens
* REST web services
* Progressive web app that works Offline
* Javascript promises
* ECMAScript 6

[Web Demo](https://agencia-demo.herokuapp.com/) *If an error appears, try again. Heroku's free tier takes a couple minutes to start up the application when not used for more than 30 minutes*
